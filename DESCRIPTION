Description: The buildmer package attempts to build, from the user's
    specifications, the largest possible regression model that will still converge,
    and then eliminates all terms from it that do not significantly contribute to an
    improvement of model deviance. Optional reordering of the terms by their
    contribution to the deviance (like SPSS) is also supported.
Depends:
